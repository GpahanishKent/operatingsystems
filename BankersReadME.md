This is the solution to the bankers algorithm 
I didn't make an custom input file but instead hard code the values from the given table to save time if thats okay
to run the program do "clang++ main.cpp"
then run the ./a.out
it will print the given safe sequence if there is one with the given values 
if not it will do nothing
